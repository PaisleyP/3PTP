Q - 
BeerCav said: â†‘
I didn't add those, those are yours to add once you have the pack in your possession bro.
Perhaps I'm not understanding how this is supposed to work. 'pack in your possession'? 
Something is not clear here. At least to me.

A - 
Each person takes turns with the pack. Say @Dinkatron4000 started with the pack. 
He could add whatever mods he wanted, change configs, do the menu. However, @BinaryTyrant is next in line. 
He wants to have the XyCraft mod in the modpack, so, once Dinkatron is finished with his turn, the pack goes to BinaryTryant, where he adds XyCraft.
Dunge wants BeerCav to add RFTools and such, but, as it is the point for each person to make their own changes, Dunge will have to wait until BeerCav is done to make his changes (which includes adding RFTools). 
It's like in the one word story game. If BeerCav is first, Dunge can't cut in line and make him say "was." He needs to wait his turn to say "was"
