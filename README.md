FTB 3rd Party Team Pack

...The concept is easy, Think of it this way, It's a run-on story.

What's that you say?

For instance, one person starts the story but only a small portion, lets say a sentence. Then it goes to the next person in line and they do the same. By the time you get to the end of the line the story pretty much writes itself as long as the one who has the pack/story tries to implement something that goes along with what's already been contributed. (That part is crucial as it will put itself together instead of all mix match like a handful of jelly beans).
If you are good at story lines or quests, then add it. If it's already there, simply add to it. Try not to deviate but add what you think/feel would take the story deeper or possibly add in a fork in the road to give the players even more to work with that would be on the side of the quest or story line.
Same thing if you happen to be good with images, please feel free to contribute to a pool as towards the end of the project we can put a poll up and have people vote on which one they like the best! ;)

When it comes to mods, I understand that there's an ungodly amount of them. So I will start the pack with some basic mods to get things rolling. But, as with the story lines and quests some of us are better at tweaking in mods than others. If you know you happen to be one of them, by all means, don't add mods, just simply do some recipe changes or what not.
The more creative you can be, the more fun we can make this! The more people we have working on this the less each of us have to do which in turn will make the project move a bit smoother and quicker, hopefully.
Only you know what you're best at or enjoy working with most. So jump in and no holds barred. Gnash your teeth and take a bit bite!! :mad:

This is simply a sign up for this pack atm so we can have some organization.

1. BeerCav - I will start the pack

2. Who's next? Sign up with a number so at the end of this I will compile a list so we can all keep track of who to send the pack to next, or who to jump in case they are say, out of the country or something and even though they signed up, can't participate.

Also, once we get started I will post in the creation forum section so that regular members can not only keep up with the pack but if they are so inclined (as we know most of them are) they can throw some ideas/opinions in.
